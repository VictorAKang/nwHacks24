## Office hours made easy... Introducing EduQueue!

*EduQueue presents a clean and minimalistic solution to waiting in line for office hours!*

## Inspiration
Overcrowded office hours are frustrating for **both students and instructors**
Neglected students and overwhelmed instructors do not create an effective learning environment.

## What it does
- EduQueue is a webpage that **features a question form for students to submit a question based on category and follower count.**
- They are then added to the **waitlist queue,** which can be viewed in full in the queue viewer. 
- The queue viewer features a **real-time clock display and a list of entries,** which are expandable for a more convenient view. 
- You can **delete the question entry** in the queue with a press of a button. 
- You can also **follow other questions  you find interesting,** and get answers even faster. 
- When your turn in the queue is up, **you will be notified.**

## How we built it
We developed this webpage through the use of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.** We used **HTTP** to connect our front end with the back end by transfering data. For collaboration, we used **VS Code, Repl.it,  and Git** for compiling and comitting codes. **JSON** was used to save data to local storage. Additional tools for design involved **Font Awesome CSS Library,  Figma and InkScape.**

## Challenges we ran into
- Joining front end and back end together as a team (we worked in 2 parts separately)
- Git commits, merge conflicts, and pulls
- Time manangement and shaping the scale of our problem that we wish to solve

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Active use of HTTP and application of asynchronous programming
- Clean and Dynamic UI/UX design 
- Implementing notification for students who reach the front of the queue


## What we learned
- Efficient collaboration with teammates
- Intricate management of simulatneous front end and back end programming 
- Understanding and utilizing local storage 
- Streamlined design and implementation of UX/UI
- Effective time and resource management

## What's next for EduQueue
- **Implementation of API for school credentials log-in, mathematic notations, and/or code block markdown**
- **Use of LLM to detect similar questions and suggetions** for following questions
- Adding **option for students to yield when they are not ready** to ask questions when reached the front of the queue
- Additional **UI/UX expansion for TAs/Instructors,** so they can also use the webpage to manage their availability during office hours

## How to run
- Open a terminal window and navigate to the backend folder
- Run ``` npm start ```
- Open the frontend/index.html file on your browser
