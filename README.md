## Office hours made easy... Introducing EduQ!



In response to the growing challenge of managing waitlisted students during office hours, we are excited to introduce our innovative Teaching Assistants Office Hours Queue Program. Recognizing the need for a streamlined and efficient solution, this program aims to revolutionize the way students access support from teaching assistants. By implementing a structured queue system, we aspire to eliminate the uncertainties and frustrations associated with waitlisting, providing students with a fair and organized approach to seeking assistance. Our program not only prioritizes student needs but also empowers teaching assistants to deliver a more focused and impactful educational experience. Together, we are reshaping the landscape of office hour accessibility, fostering an environment where both students and teaching assistants can thrive.
